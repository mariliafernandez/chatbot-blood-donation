The donation process from the time you arrive until the time you leave takes about an hour.&amp;nbsp;The donation itself is only about 8-10 minutes on average.&amp;nbsp;The steps in the process are:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Registration&lt;/p>
&lt;ol style=list-style-position: inside;>
&lt;li>You will complete donor registration, which includes information such as your name, address, phone number, and donor identification number (if you have one).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You will be asked to show a donor card, driver’s license or two other forms of ID.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Health History and Mini Physical&lt;/p>
&lt;ol style=list-style-position: inside;>
&lt;li>You&amp;nbsp;will answer some&amp;nbsp;questions&amp;nbsp;during a private and confidential interview about your health history and the places you have traveled.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You will have your temperature, hemoglobin, blood pressure and pulse checked.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Donation&lt;/p>
&lt;ol style=list-style-position: inside;>
&lt;li>We&amp;nbsp;will cleanse an area on your arm and insert a brand–new, sterile needle for the blood draw. This feels like a quick pinch and is over in seconds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You will have some time to relax while the bag is filling. (For a whole blood donation, it is about 8-10 minutes. If you are donating platelets, red cells or plasma by apheresis the collection can take up to 2 hours.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When approximately a pint of blood has been collected, the donation is complete and a staff person will place a bandage on your arm.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Refreshments&lt;/p>
&lt;ol style=list-style-position: inside;>
&lt;li>You will spend a few minutes enjoying refreshments to allow your body time to adjust to the slight decrease in fluid volume. &lt;/li>
&lt;li>After 10-15 minutes you can then leave the donation site and continue with your normal daily activities. &lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enjoy the feeling of accomplishment knowing that you have helped to save lives.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Your gift of blood may help up to three people. Donated red blood cells do not last forever. They have a shelf-life of up to 42 days. A healthy donor may donate every 56 days.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>Take the following precautions&lt;/b>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul style=list-style-position: inside;>
&lt;li>Drink an extra four glasses (eight ounces each) of non-alcoholic liquids.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keep your bandage on and dry for the next five hours, and do not do heavy exercising or lifting.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the needle site starts to bleed, raise your arm straight up and press on the site until the bleeding stops.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Because you could experience dizziness or loss of strength, use caution if you plan to do anything that could put you or others at risk of harm. For any hazardous occupation or hobby, follow applicable safety recommendations regarding your return to these activities following a blood donation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Eat healthy meals and consider adding &lt;a href=https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/before-during-after/iron-blood-donation.html target=_blank>iron-rich foods&lt;/a> to your regular diet, or discuss taking an iron supplement with your health care provider, to replace the iron lost with blood donation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;b>If you get a bruise&lt;/b>:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Apply ice to the area intermittently for 10-15 minutes during the first 24 hours. Thereafter, apply warm, moist heat to the area intermittently for 10-15 minutes. A rainbow of colors may occur for about 10 days.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;b>If you get dizzy or lightheaded&lt;/b>:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Stop what you are doing, lie down, and raise your feet until the feeling passes and you feel well enough to safely resume activities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;b>And remember to enjoy the feeling of knowing you have helped save lives!&lt;/b>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;b>Schedule your next appointment&lt;/b>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

Some individuals may be at risk of transferring communicable disease through blood donation due to exposure via travel or other activities or may encounter problems with blood donation due to their health.

The word “apheresis” is derived from the Greek word aphaeresis meaning “to take away.” This process is accomplished by using a machine called a cell separator. Blood is drawn from the donor and the platelets, or another blood component, are collected by the cell separator and the remaining components of the blood are returned to the donor during the donation. Each apheresis donation procedure takes about one-and-one-half to two hours. Donors can watch movies or relax during the donation.&lt;br>

Platelets are critically important to the survival of many patients with clotting problems (aplastic anemia, leukemia) or cancer, and patients who will undergo organ transplants or major surgeries like heart bypass grafts. Platelets can only be stored for five days after being collected. Maintaining an adequate supply of this lifesaving, perishable product is an ongoing challenge.&lt;br />

By identifying a donor’s race and ethnicity, it helps the Red Cross better and more efficiently locate rare blood types to best meet the needs of all patients of all backgrounds. Certain blood characteristics are inherited, making them more likely to be found within certain donor groups. These matched blood products provide a more compatible unit for transfusion to patients in need.&lt;/p>

In some cases, this is because the Red Cross immunohematology reference laboratory may have previously tested their donation for sickle cell trait at the request of a hospital to fulfill a specific product need. In these cases, the donor may have received a previous result of negative or positive. While the Red Cross will work to resolve many inconsistent results, a portion will remain inconsistent.&lt;b> &lt;/b>&lt;/p>

Carrying the sickle cell trait does not mean that an individual has sickle cell disease. Individuals who only carry the sickle cell trait are eligible to donate platelets and plasma.&lt;/p>

This screening is performed on a blood sample given during the standard donation process to look for the presence of an abnormal type of hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S or sickled hemoglobin, a key indicator of sickle cell trait. This means it is likely the individual inherited one sickle cell gene and one normal gene from their parents. If an individual receives a positive result, they should consult their medical provider to discuss their test results and pursue additional confirmatory diagnostic testing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

While, carrying the trait does not mean that an individual has sickle cell disease, health experts recommend that individuals with sickle cell trait be aware of their status and consult their medical provider on what it means for them. In general, many individuals who carry the sickle cell trait have no medical problems related to sickle cell trait.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

However, these screening are not perfect. As with all tests and screening, false results, or a screening result that incorrectly states the presence of abnormal hemoglobin, can occur. This is why those who receive a positive result are encouraged to consult their medical provider for confirmatory testing and discuss what their results mean for them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

This means that the individual is likely not a sickle cell trait carrier. It is important to note, that the Red Cross is not screening for other abnormal hemoglobin cells that can also cause sickling – such as hemoglobin C.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Recent research has shown that sickle cell trait-positive whole blood and Power Red donations do not adequately pass a quality control step due to a filter limitation during processing. As a result, after Aug. 7 donors who test positive for sickle cell trait – and current donors whose donations do not adequately pass the red blood cell filter process – are restricted from giving a whole blood or Power Red donations. It’s important to note that this is an industrywide filter limitation and not a donor issue.&lt;/p>

For a limited time, we are also expanding our screening to include all blood, platelet and plasma donations from self-identified multiracial and Black or African American donors to allow us to identify compatible blood donations even faster to help patients in need of a blood transfusion.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Donations from Black individuals who do not carry the sickle cell trait are often the most compatible blood products for sickle cell patients. However, 51% of African Americans have type O (positive or negative) blood, in comparison to approximately 45% of white individuals. Type O blood is most often in critical supply as it is most often needed by hospitals. Black donors play a vital role in helping meet the needs of all patients including – individuals who experience complicated childbirths, people fighting cancer, and accident victims being raced to emergency rooms.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

This will provide the most expedient access to test results. If a donor has questions or issues with the Blood Donor App or portal functionality, please contact 855-210-1278. If a donor does not have internet service and therefore cannot use the two recommended channels, they may call the Red Cross Donor and Client Support Center 14 days after donation at 1-866-236-3276 to obtain their results.&lt;b>&lt;/b>&lt;/p>

This test is used to detect abnormal sickling hemoglobin cells or hemoglobin S.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We recognize there are other abnormal hemoglobin cells that can cause sickling. However, this test rarely detects presence of these other hemoglobin cells.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

Donors will need to have a successful donation to receive sickle cell trait screening results. Per standard procedures, only successful donations are sent to our laboratory for testing.&lt;b>&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&#34;,&#34;category&#34;: {&#34;name&#34;: &#34;Sickle Cell Trait Screening&#34;,&#34;slug&#34;: &#34;donating-blood-sickle-cell-trait-screen&#34;}},{&#34;title&#34;: &#34;What does it mean to have a positive sickle cell screening result? &#34;,&#34;description&#34;: &#34;&lt;p>A positive result indicates that the screening detected the presence of an abnormal type of hemoglobin called hemoglobin S or sickled hemoglobin, a key indicator of sickle cell trait. This means it is likely the individual inherited one sickle cell gene and one normal gene from their parents. If an individual receives a positive result, they should consult their medical provider to discuss their test results and pursue additional confirmatory testing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to providing individuals with their results via the Blood Donor App and donor portal on RedCrossBlood.org, those who have positive results will also receive a letter in the mail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s important to note, that carrying the sickle cell trait does not mean that an individual has sickle cell disease. In general, many individuals who carry the sickle cell trait have no medical problems related to sickle cell trait.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

Both screenings are authorized for use by the FDA and are highly accurate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

The Red Cross is only required to report positive sickle cell trait results in writing to donor. We do encourage those individuals who receive a positive sickle cell trait result to consult their medical provider to discuss their test results and pursue additional confirmatory testing.&lt;/p>
&#34;,&#34;category&#34;: {&#34;name&#34;: &#34;Sickle Cell Trait Screening&#34;,&#34;slug&#34;: &#34;donating-blood-sickle-cell-trait-screen&#34;}},{&#34;title&#34;: &#34;What if a donor does not want to have their donation screened for sickle cell trait? &#34;,&#34;description&#34;: &#34;&lt;p>If an individual does not want their donation to be screened for sickle cell trait, they should select the “I prefer not to answer or other” response regarding their race and ethnicity. Only donations&lt;b>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>from self-identified multiracial and Black or African American donors will be screened for sickle cell trait.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Self-identifying your race and ethnicity helps the Red Cross better and more efficiently locate rare blood types to best meet the needs of all patients of all backgrounds. Certain blood characteristics are inherited making them more likely to be found within certain donor groups. These matched blood products provide a more compatible unit for transfusion to patients in need.&lt;/p>

This information, along with other blood type attributes becomes part of an individual’s confidential donor record and is used to help the Red Cross identify compatible units for patients in crisis as quickly as possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

As a result, donors who test positive for sickle cell trait after August &amp;nbsp;7 – and current donors whose donations do not adequately pass the red blood cell filter process – are restricted from giving a whole blood or Power Red donations. It’s important to note that this is an industry-wide filter limitation and not a donor issue.&lt;/p>

The donation process from the time you arrive until the time you leave takes about an hour.&amp;nbsp;The donation itself is only about 8-10 minutes on average.&amp;nbsp;The steps in the process are:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Registration&lt;/p>
&lt;ol style=list-style-position: inside;>
&lt;li>You will complete donor registration, which includes information such as your name, address, phone number, and donor identification number (if you have one).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You will be asked to show a donor card, driver’s license or two other forms of ID.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Health History and Mini Physical&lt;/p>
&lt;ol style=list-style-position: inside;>
&lt;li>You&amp;nbsp;will answer some&amp;nbsp;questions&amp;nbsp;during a private and confidential interview about your health history and the places you have traveled.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You will have your temperature, hemoglobin, blood pressure and pulse checked.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Donation&lt;/p>
&lt;ol style=list-style-position: inside;>
&lt;li>We&amp;nbsp;will cleanse an area on your arm and insert a brand–new, sterile needle for the blood draw. This feels like a quick pinch and is over in seconds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You will have some time to relax while the bag is filling. (For a whole blood donation, it is about 8-10 minutes. If you are donating platelets, red cells or plasma by apheresis the collection can take up to 2 hours.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When approximately a pint of blood has been collected, the donation is complete and a staff person will place a bandage on your arm.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Refreshments&lt;/p>
&lt;ol style=list-style-position: inside;>
&lt;li>You will spend a few minutes enjoying refreshments to allow your body time to adjust to the slight decrease in fluid volume. &lt;/li>
&lt;li>After 10-15 minutes you can then leave the donation site and continue with your normal daily activities. &lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enjoy the feeling of accomplishment knowing that you have helped to save lives.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Your gift of blood may help up to three people. Donated red blood cells do not last forever. They have a shelf-life of up to 42 days. A healthy donor may donate every 56 days.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>Take the following precautions&lt;/b>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul style=list-style-position: inside;>
&lt;li>Drink an extra four glasses (eight ounces each) of non-alcoholic liquids.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keep your bandage on and dry for the next five hours, and do not do heavy exercising or lifting.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the needle site starts to bleed, raise your arm straight up and press on the site until the bleeding stops.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Because you could experience dizziness or loss of strength, use caution if you plan to do anything that could put you or others at risk of harm. For any hazardous occupation or hobby, follow applicable safety recommendations regarding your return to these activities following a blood donation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Eat healthy meals and consider adding &lt;a href=https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/before-during-after/iron-blood-donation.html target=_blank>iron-rich foods&lt;/a> to your regular diet, or discuss taking an iron supplement with your health care provider, to replace the iron lost with blood donation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;b>If you get a bruise&lt;/b>:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Apply ice to the area intermittently for 10-15 minutes during the first 24 hours. Thereafter, apply warm, moist heat to the area intermittently for 10-15 minutes. A rainbow of colors may occur for about 10 days.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;b>If you get dizzy or lightheaded&lt;/b>:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Stop what you are doing, lie down, and raise your feet until the feeling passes and you feel well enough to safely resume activities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;b>And remember to enjoy the feeling of knowing you have helped save lives!&lt;/b>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;b>Schedule your next appointment&lt;/b>.&lt;/li>

The word “apheresis” is derived from the Greek word aphaeresis meaning “to take away.” This process is accomplished by using a machine called a cell separator. Blood is drawn from the donor and the platelets, or another blood component, are collected by the cell separator and the remaining components of the blood are returned to the donor during the donation. Each apheresis donation procedure takes about one-and-one-half to two hours. Donors can watch movies or relax during the donation.&lt;br>

Platelets are critically important to the survival of many patients with clotting problems (aplastic anemia, leukemia) or cancer, and patients who will undergo organ transplants or major surgeries like heart bypass grafts. Platelets can only be stored for five days after being collected. Maintaining an adequate supply of this lifesaving, perishable product is an ongoing challenge.&lt;br />

By identifying a donor’s race and ethnicity, it helps the Red Cross better and more efficiently locate rare blood types to best meet the needs of all patients of all backgrounds. Certain blood characteristics are inherited, making them more likely to be found within certain donor groups. These matched blood products provide a more compatible unit for transfusion to patients in need.&lt;/p>

In some cases, this is because the Red Cross immunohematology reference laboratory may have previously tested their donation for sickle cell trait at the request of a hospital to fulfill a specific product need. In these cases, the donor may have received a previous result of negative or positive. While the Red Cross will work to resolve many inconsistent results, a portion will remain inconsistent.&lt;b> &lt;/b>&lt;/p>

Carrying the sickle cell trait does not mean that an individual has sickle cell disease. Individuals who only carry the sickle cell trait are eligible to donate platelets and plasma.&lt;/p>

This screening is performed on a blood sample given during the standard donation process to look for the presence of an abnormal type of hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S or sickled hemoglobin, a key indicator of sickle cell trait. This means it is likely the individual inherited one sickle cell gene and one normal gene from their parents.

In addition, this screening helps the Red Cross identify compatible blood types to help sickle cell patients more quickly.&lt;/p>

This means that the individual is likely not a sickle cell trait carrier. It is important to note, that the Red Cross is not screening for other abnormal hemoglobin cells that can also cause sickling – such as hemoglobin C.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

Blood, platelet and plasma donations will be screened using samples obtained at the time of donation and sent to a testing laboratory where the samples will also undergo routine screening and infectious disease testing.&lt;b>&lt;/b>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Recent research has shown that sickle cell trait-positive whole blood and Power Red donations do not adequately pass a quality control step due to a filter limitation during processing. As a result, after Aug. 7 donors who test positive for sickle cell trait – and current donors whose donations do not adequately pass the red blood cell filter process – are restricted from giving a whole blood or Power Red donations. It’s important to note that this is an industrywide filter limitation and not a donor issue.&lt;/p>

For a limited time, we are also expanding our screening to include all blood, platelet and plasma donations from self-identified multiracial and Black or African American donors to allow us to identify compatible blood donations even faster to help patients in need of a blood transfusion.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Donations from Black individuals who do not carry the sickle cell trait are often the most compatible blood products for sickle cell patients. However, 51% of African Americans have type O (positive or negative) blood, in comparison to approximately 45% of white individuals. Type O blood is most often in critical supply as it is most often needed by hospitals. Black donors play a vital role in helping meet the needs of all patients including – individuals who experience complicated childbirths, people fighting cancer, and accident victims being raced to emergency rooms.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

This will provide the most expedient access to test results. If a donor has questions or issues with the Blood Donor App or portal functionality, please contact 855-210-1278. If a donor does not have internet service and therefore cannot use the two recommended channels, they may call the Red Cross Donor and Client Support Center 14 days after donation at 1-866-236-3276 to obtain their results.&lt;b>&lt;/b>&lt;/p>

This test is used to detect abnormal sickling hemoglobin cells or hemoglobin S.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We recognize there are other abnormal hemoglobin cells that can cause sickling. However, this test rarely detects presence of these other hemoglobin cells.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

Donors will need to have a successful donation to receive sickle cell trait screening results. Per standard procedures, only successful donations are sent to our laboratory for testing.&lt;b>&lt;/b>&lt;/p>
&#34;,&#34;category&#34;: {&#34;name&#34;: &#34;Sickle Cell Trait Screening&#34;,&#34;slug&#34;: &#34;donating-blood-sickle-cell-trait-screen&#34;}},{&#34;title&#34;: &#34;What does it mean to have a positive sickle cell screening result? &#34;,&#34;description&#34;: &#34;&lt;p>A positive result indicates that the screening detected the presence of an abnormal type of hemoglobin called hemoglobin S or sickled hemoglobin, a key indicator of sickle cell trait. This means it is likely the individual inherited one sickle cell gene and one normal gene from their parents. If an individual receives a positive result, they should consult their medical provider to discuss their test results and pursue additional confirmatory testing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to providing individuals with their results via the Blood Donor App and donor portal on RedCrossBlood.org, those who have positive results will also receive a letter in the mail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s important to note, that carrying the sickle cell trait does not mean that an individual has sickle cell disease. In general, many individuals who carry the sickle cell trait have no medical problems related to sickle cell trait.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

Both screenings are authorized for use by the FDA and are highly accurate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

The Red Cross is only required to report positive sickle cell trait results in writing to donor. We do encourage those individuals who receive a positive sickle cell trait result to consult their medical provider to discuss their test results and pursue additional confirmatory testing.&lt;/p>

Only donations&lt;b>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>from self-identified multiracial and Black or African American donors will be screened for sickle cell trait.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Self-identifying your race and ethnicity helps the Red Cross better and more efficiently locate rare blood types to best meet the needs of all patients of all backgrounds. Certain blood characteristics are inherited making them more likely to be found within certain donor groups. These matched blood products provide a more compatible unit for transfusion to patients in need.&lt;/p>

Blood volume is determined by body weight and height. Individuals with low blood volumes may not tolerate the removal of the required volume of blood given with whole blood donation. There is no upper weight limit as long as your weight is not higher than the weight limit of the donor bed/lounge you are using. You can discuss any upper weight limitations of beds and lounges with your local health historian.&lt;/p>

If you have traveled outside of the United States and Canada, your travel destinations will be reviewed at the time of donation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Come prepared to your donation process with your travel details when you donate. You can download the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=/content/dam/redcrossblood/documents/travel_for-2.pdf target=_blank>travel form&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;and bring it with you to help in the assessment of your travel. You can call&amp;nbsp;&lt;b>866-236-3276&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;to speak with an eligibility specialist about your travel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If, in the past 3 years, you have been outside the United States or Canada:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What countries did you visit?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Where did you travel while in this country?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Did you leave the city or resort at any time? If yes, where did you go?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What mode of transportation did you use?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How long did you stay?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What date did you return to the U.S.?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Malaria is transmitted by mosquito bite in certain countries and may be transmitted to patients through blood transfusion. As such the FDA requires the Red Cross and other blood collection organizations to ask individuals to disclose during the donation process if they have traveled to or lived in malaria-countries or if they have had malaria.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;span style=background-color: transparent;>The FDA does not currently require blood collectors to test blood donations for malaria. However, in March 2024 the FDA approved the first test of its kind with the ability to screen blood donations for malaria. It’s important to know that the Red Cross is committed to ensuring the safety of the blood supply and is currently working with our industry partners and the FDA to evaluate current eligibility guidance regarding malaria and the newly approved test as well as other possible tests awaiting approval.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have traveled or lived in a malaria-risk country, a waiting period is required before you can donate blood&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Wait 3 years after completing treatment for malaria.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wait 3 months after returning from a trip to an area where malaria is found.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wait 3 years after living more than 5 years in a country or countries where malaria is found. An additional waiting period of 3 years is required if you have traveled to an area where malaria is found if you have not lived a consecutive 3 years in a country or countries where malaria is not found.&lt;/li>

However, in March 2024 the FDA approved the first test of its kind with the ability to screen blood donations for malaria. It’s important to know that the Red Cross is committed to ensuring the safety of the blood supply and is currently working with our industry partners and the FDA to evaluate current eligibility guidance regarding malaria and the newly approved test as well as other possible tests awaiting approval.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have traveled or lived in a malaria-risk country, a waiting period is required before you can donate blood.&lt;/p>

The donation process from the time you arrive until the time you leave takes about an hour.&amp;nbsp;The donation itself is only about 8-10 minutes on average.&amp;nbsp;The steps in the process are:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Registration&lt;/p>
&lt;ol style=list-style-position: inside;>
&lt;li>You will complete donor registration, which includes information such as your name, address, phone number, and donor identification number (if you have one).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You will be asked to show a donor card, driver’s license or two other forms of ID.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Health History and Mini Physical&lt;/p>
&lt;ol style=list-style-position: inside;>
&lt;li>You&amp;nbsp;will answer some&amp;nbsp;questions&amp;nbsp;during a private and confidential interview about your health history and the places you have traveled.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You will have your temperature, hemoglobin, blood pressure and pulse checked.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Donation&lt;/p>
&lt;ol style=list-style-position: inside;>
&lt;li>We&amp;nbsp;will cleanse an area on your arm and insert a brand–new, sterile needle for the blood draw. This feels like a quick pinch and is over in seconds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You will have some time to relax while the bag is filling. (For a whole blood donation, it is about 8-10 minutes. If you are donating platelets, red cells or plasma by apheresis the collection can take up to 2 hours.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When approximately a pint of blood has been collected, the donation is complete and a staff person will place a bandage on your arm.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Refreshments&lt;/p>
&lt;ol style=list-style-position: inside;>
&lt;li>You will spend a few minutes enjoying refreshments to allow your body time to adjust to the slight decrease in fluid volume. &lt;/li>
&lt;li>After 10-15 minutes you can then leave the donation site and continue with your normal daily activities. &lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enjoy the feeling of accomplishment knowing that you have helped to save lives.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Your gift of blood may help up to three people. Donated red blood cells do not last forever. They have a shelf-life of up to 42 days. A healthy donor may donate every 56 days.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>Take the following precautions&lt;/b>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul style=list-style-position: inside;>
&lt;li>Drink an extra four glasses (eight ounces each) of non-alcoholic liquids.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keep your bandage on and dry for the next five hours, and do not do heavy exercising or lifting.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the needle site starts to bleed, raise your arm straight up and press on the site until the bleeding stops.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Because you could experience dizziness or loss of strength, use caution if you plan to do anything that could put you or others at risk of harm. For any hazardous occupation or hobby, follow applicable safety recommendations regarding your return to these activities following a blood donation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Eat healthy meals and consider adding &lt;a href=https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/before-during-after/iron-blood-donation.html target=_blank>iron-rich foods&lt;/a> to your regular diet, or discuss taking an iron supplement with your health care provider, to replace the iron lost with blood donation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;b>If you get a bruise&lt;/b>:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Apply ice to the area intermittently for 10-15 minutes during the first 24 hours. Thereafter, apply warm, moist heat to the area intermittently for 10-15 minutes. A rainbow of colors may occur for about 10 days.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;b>If you get dizzy or lightheaded&lt;/b>:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Stop what you are doing, lie down, and raise your feet until the feeling passes and you feel well enough to safely resume activities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;b>And remember to enjoy the feeling of knowing you have helped save lives!&lt;/b>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;b>Schedule your next appointment&lt;/b>.&lt;/li>

The word “apheresis” is derived from the Greek word aphaeresis meaning “to take away.” This process is accomplished by using a machine called a cell separator. Blood is drawn from the donor and the platelets, or another blood component, are collected by the cell separator and the remaining components of the blood are returned to the donor during the donation. Each apheresis donation procedure takes about one-and-one-half to two hours. Donors can watch movies or relax during the donation.&lt;br>

By identifying a donor’s race and ethnicity, it helps the Red Cross better and more efficiently locate rare blood types to best meet the needs of all patients of all backgrounds. Certain blood characteristics are inherited, making them more likely to be found within certain donor groups. These matched blood products provide a more compatible unit for transfusion to patients in need.&lt;/p>

In some cases, this is because the Red Cross immunohematology reference laboratory may have previously tested their donation for sickle cell trait at the request of a hospital to fulfill a specific product need. In these cases, the donor may have received a previous result of negative or positive. While the Red Cross will work to resolve many inconsistent results, a portion will remain inconsistent.&lt;b> &lt;/b>&lt;/p>

This screening is performed on a blood sample given during the standard donation process to look for the presence of an abnormal type of hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S or sickled hemoglobin, a key indicator of sickle cell trait. This means it is likely the individual inherited one sickle cell gene and one normal gene from their parents.

&lt;p>Recent research has shown that sickle cell trait-positive whole blood and Power Red donations do not adequately pass a quality control step due to a filter limitation during processing. As a result, after Aug. 7 donors who test positive for sickle cell trait – and current donors whose donations do not adequately pass the red blood cell filter process – are restricted from giving a whole blood or Power Red donations. It’s important to note that this is an industrywide filter limitation and not a donor issue.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Donations from Black individuals who do not carry the sickle cell trait are often the most compatible blood products for sickle cell patients. However, 51% of African Americans have type O (positive or negative) blood, in comparison to approximately 45% of white individuals. Type O blood is most often in critical supply as it is most often needed by hospitals. Black donors play a vital role in helping meet the needs of all patients including – individuals who experience complicated childbirths, people fighting cancer, and accident victims being raced to emergency rooms.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

If you have traveled outside of the United States and Canada, your travel destinations will be reviewed at the time of donation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Come prepared to your donation process with your travel details when you donate. You can download the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=/content/dam/redcrossblood/documents/travel_for-2.pdf target=_blank>travel form&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;and bring it with you to help in the assessment of your travel.

&lt;p>Malaria is transmitted by mosquito bite in certain countries and may be transmitted to patients through blood transfusion. As such the FDA requires the Red Cross and other blood collection organizations to ask individuals to disclose during the donation process if they have traveled to or lived in malaria-countries or if they have had malaria.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;span style=background-color: transparent;>The FDA does not currently require blood collectors to test blood donations for malaria. However, in March 2024 the FDA approved the first test of its kind with the ability to screen blood donations for malaria. It’s important to know that the Red Cross is committed to ensuring the safety of the blood supply and is currently working with our industry partners and the FDA to evaluate current eligibility guidance regarding malaria and the newly approved test as well as other possible tests awaiting approval.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have traveled or lived in a malaria-risk country, a waiting period is required before you can donate blood&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Wait 3 years after completing treatment for malaria.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wait 3 months after returning from a trip to an area where malaria is found.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wait 3 years after living more than 5 years in a country or countries where malaria is found. An additional waiting period of 3 years is required if you have traveled to an area where malaria is found if you have not lived a consecutive 3 years in a country or countries where malaria is not found.&lt;/li>

The donation process from the time you arrive until the time you leave takes about an hour.&amp;nbsp;The donation itself is only about 8-10 minutes on average.&amp;nbsp;The steps in the process are:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Registration&lt;/p>
&lt;ol style=list-style-position: inside;>
&lt;li>You will complete donor registration, which includes information such as your name, address, phone number, and donor identification number (if you have one).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You will be asked to show a donor card, driver’s license or two other forms of ID.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Health History and Mini Physical&lt;/p>
&lt;ol style=list-style-position: inside;>
&lt;li>You&amp;nbsp;will answer some&amp;nbsp;questions&amp;nbsp;during a private and confidential interview about your health history and the places you have traveled.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You will have your temperature, hemoglobin, blood pressure and pulse checked.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Donation&lt;/p>
&lt;ol style=list-style-position: inside;>
&lt;li>We&amp;nbsp;will cleanse an area on your arm and insert a brand–new, sterile needle for the blood draw. This feels like a quick pinch and is over in seconds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You will have some time to relax while the bag is filling. (For a whole blood donation, it is about 8-10 minutes. If you are donating platelets, red cells or plasma by apheresis the collection can take up to 2 hours.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When approximately a pint of blood has been collected, the donation is complete and a staff person will place a bandage on your arm.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Refreshments&lt;/p>
&lt;ol style=list-style-position: inside;>
&lt;li>You will spend a few minutes enjoying refreshments to allow your body time to adjust to the slight decrease in fluid volume. &lt;/li>
&lt;li>After 10-15 minutes you can then leave the donation site and continue with your normal daily activities. &lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enjoy the feeling of accomplishment knowing that you have helped to save lives.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Your gift of blood may help up to three people. Donated red blood cells do not last forever. They have a shelf-life of up to 42 days. A healthy donor may donate every 56 days.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;b>Take the following precautions&lt;/b>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul style=list-style-position: inside;>
&lt;li>Drink an extra four glasses (eight ounces each) of non-alcoholic liquids.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keep your bandage on and dry for the next five hours, and do not do heavy exercising or lifting.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If the needle site starts to bleed, raise your arm straight up and press on the site until the bleeding stops.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Because you could experience dizziness or loss of strength, use caution if you plan to do anything that could put you or others at risk of harm. For any hazardous occupation or hobby, follow applicable safety recommendations regarding your return to these activities following a blood donation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Eat healthy meals and consider adding &lt;a href=https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/before-during-after/iron-blood-donation.html target=_blank>iron-rich foods&lt;/a> to your regular diet, or discuss taking an iron supplement with your health care provider, to replace the iron lost with blood donation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;b>If you get a bruise&lt;/b>:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Apply ice to the area intermittently for 10-15 minutes during the first 24 hours. Thereafter, apply warm, moist heat to the area intermittently for 10-15 minutes. A rainbow of colors may occur for about 10 days.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;b>If you get dizzy or lightheaded&lt;/b>:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Stop what you are doing, lie down, and raise your feet until the feeling passes and you feel well enough to safely resume activities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;b>And remember to enjoy the feeling of knowing you have helped save lives!&lt;/b>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;b>Schedule your next appointment&lt;/b>.&lt;/li>

The word “apheresis” is derived from the Greek word aphaeresis meaning “to take away.” This process is accomplished by using a machine called a cell separator. Blood is drawn from the donor and the platelets, or another blood component, are collected by the cell separator and the remaining components of the blood are returned to the donor during the donation. Each apheresis donation procedure takes about one-and-one-half to two hours. Donors can watch movies or relax during the donation.&lt;br>

&lt;li>&lt;b>Smallpox/ Monkeypox vaccine&lt;/b>:&lt;b>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>There are two types of Smallpox/Monkeypox vaccines so you must know the name of the vaccine to determine if you may be eligible to donate. If you do not know the name of the vaccine you received, you must wait 8 weeks to donate as a precaution.&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;b>ACAM2000 vaccine&lt;/b>: This is an older vaccine which is administered in a single dose by inoculation (pricking the skin surface several times with a needle).&amp;nbsp; If you receive the ACAM2000 smallpox/monkeypox vaccine, which is a live virus vaccine containing infectious agents then the following apply:&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;span style=background-color: transparent;>&lt;b>Smallpox/Monkeypox vaccination and did not develop complications&lt;/b>.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>Wait 8 weeks (56 days) after receiving the vaccination to donate blood as long as you have no complications. Complications can include skin reactions beyond the vaccination site or general illness related to the vaccination.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;span style=background-color: transparent;>&lt;b>Smallpox/Monkeypox vaccination and developed complications&lt;/b>.&amp;nbsp;Wait 14 days after all vaccine complications have resolved or 8 weeks (56 days) from the date of having had the smallpox vaccination whichever is the longer period of time. Discuss your particular situation with the health historian at the time of donation. Complications can include skin reactions beyond the vaccination site or general illness related to the vaccination.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;span style=background-color: transparent;>&lt;b>Jynneos vaccine&lt;/b>: This is a new vaccine that is administered in 2 doses (shots) given 4 weeks apart.&amp;nbsp; If you receive the newer smallpox/monkeypox vaccine called Jynneos, which is a nonreplicating live virus vaccine, which does not contain infectious agents, your eligibility to donate blood is determined based on exposure to Monkeypox.&lt;/span>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;span style=background-color: transparent;>If you received this vaccine after an exposure to Monkeypox, you cannot donate for 21 days after your last exposure.&lt;/span>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;span style=background-color: transparent;>If there is no exposure to monkeypox and you received this vaccine, there is no deferral.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;b>Smallpox vaccination – close contact with someone who has had the smallpox vaccine in the last eight weeks and you did not develop any skin lesions or other symptoms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b>Eligible to donate.&lt;br>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;b>Smallpox vaccination – close contact with someone who has had the vaccine in the last eight weeks and you have since developed skin lesions or symptoms.&lt;/b>&lt;br>
Wait 8 weeks (56 days) from the date of the first skin lesion or sore. Discuss your particular situation with the health historian at the time of donation. Complications can include skin reactions or general illness related to the exposure.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;span style=background-color: transparent;>The FDA does not currently require blood collectors to test blood donations for malaria. However, in March 2024 the FDA approved the first test of its kind with the ability to screen blood donations for malaria.

Registration

You will complete donor registration, which includes information such as your name, address, phone number, and donor identification number (if you have one).
You will be asked to show a donor card, driver’s license or two other forms of ID.
Health History and Mini Physical

You will answer some questions during a private and confidential interview about your health history and the places you have traveled.
You will have your temperature, hemoglobin, blood pressure and pulse checked.
Donation

We will cleanse an area on your arm and insert a brand–new, sterile needle for the blood draw. This feels like a quick pinch and is over in seconds.
You will have some time to relax while the bag is filling. (For a whole blood donation, it is about 8-10 minutes. If you are donating platelets, red cells or plasma by apheresis the collection can take up to 2 hours.)
When approximately a pint of blood has been collected, the donation is complete and a staff person will place a bandage on your arm. 
Refreshments

You will spend a few minutes enjoying refreshments to allow your body time to adjust to the slight decrease in fluid volume.
After 10-15 minutes you can then leave the donation site and continue with your normal daily activities.
Enjoy the feeling of accomplishment knowing that you have helped to save lives.
Your gift of blood may help up to three people. Donated red blood cells do not last forever. They have a shelf-life of up to 42 days. A healthy donor may donate every 56 days."

      "text": "After you give blood:

Take the following precautions:

Drink an extra four glasses (eight ounces each) of non-alcoholic liquids.
Keep your bandage on and dry for the next five hours, and do not do heavy exercising or lifting.
If the needle site starts to bleed, raise your arm straight up and press on the site until the bleeding stops.
Because you could experience dizziness or loss of strength, use caution if you plan to do anything that could put you or others at risk of harm. For any hazardous occupation or hobby, follow applicable safety recommendations regarding your return to these activities following a blood donation.
Eat healthy meals and consider adding iron-rich foods to your regular diet, or discuss taking an iron supplement with your health care provider, to replace the iron lost with blood donation.
If you get a bruise:  Apply ice to the area intermittently for 10-15 minutes during the first 24 hours. Thereafter, apply warm, moist heat to the area intermittently for 10-15 minutes. A rainbow of colors may occur for about 10 days.
If you get dizzy or lightheaded:  Stop what you are doing, lie down, and raise your feet until the feeling passes and you feel well enough to safely resume activities.
And remember to enjoy the feeling of knowing you have helped save lives!
Schedule your next appointment."

Amid this coronavirus emergency, we are asking individuals to take this responsibility seriously by practicing social distancing and donating blood. These two activities—which are not mutually exclusive—will go a long way in keeping community members healthy by slowing the spread of the virus and by ensuring that patients across the country receive lifesaving blood.
We understand that people have concerns right now about all aspects of public health, but want to stress that donating blood is a safe process and people should not hesitate to give. It’s important to note that blood drives have highest standards of safety and infection control.

One test detects antibodies to the spike protein of the virus, that are produced in response to viral infection or the vaccine. The other detects antibodies to a different part of the virus called the nucleocapsid protein, which are produced in response to infection, but not by current vaccines. If a donor has had the COVID-19 vaccine, they will generate antibodies against the spike protein but not the nucleocapsid protein, which will only occur in the event of a COVID-19 infection.

Following the roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccines, this happens most frequently for individuals who have received a COVID-19 vaccine but have not had the virus itself. If the interpretation of a donor’s antibody test result changed and the donor has received a COVID-19 vaccine it means that an antibody response has been detected to the spike protein of the virus.

Donors who were previously deferred under the prior MSM policy will be evaluated for reinstatement. It is important to understand that the donor reinstatement process involves potentially thousands of donors, and it will take time.
Individuals who have been deferred for MSM in the past may initiate donor reinstatement by contacting the Red Cross Donor and Client Support Center at 1-866-236-3276. Individuals with questions about their donation eligibility can contact the Red Cross Donor and Client Support Center at 1-866-236-3276. We appreciate the patience of our valued donors as we continue to diligently work to implement these changes so that more people can give blood for those in need.
For the purposes of blood donation gender is self-identified and self-reported, which is relevant to the transgender community.
More information about the FDA policy is available for LGBTQ+ donors.
