            "question": "How does the blood donation process work?",
            "answer": "Donating\u00a0blood is a simple thing to do, but can make a big difference in the lives of others. The donation process from the time you arrive until the time you leave takes about an hour.\u00a0The donation itself is only about 8-10 minutes on average.\u00a0The steps in the process are:\nRegistration\n\nYou will complete donor registration, which includes information such as your name, address, phone number, and donor identification number (if you have one).\nYou will be asked to show a donor card, driver\u2019s license or two other forms of ID.\n\nHealth History and Mini Physical\n\nYou\u00a0will answer some\u00a0questions\u00a0during a private and confidential interview about your health history and the places you have traveled.\nYou will have your temperature, hemoglobin, blood pressure and pulse checked.\n\nDonation\n\nWe\u00a0will cleanse an area on your arm and insert a brand\u2013new, sterile needle for the blood draw. This feels like a quick pinch and is over in seconds.\nYou will have some time to relax while the bag is filling. (For a whole blood donation, it is about 8-10 minutes. If you are donating platelets, red cells or plasma by apheresis the collection can take up to 2 hours.)\nWhen approximately a pint of blood has been collected, the donation is complete and a staff person will place a bandage on your arm.\u00a0\n\nRefreshments\n\nYou will spend a few minutes enjoying refreshments to allow your body time to adjust to the slight decrease in fluid volume. \nAfter 10-15 minutes you can then leave the donation site and continue with your normal daily activities. \nEnjoy the feeling of accomplishment knowing that you have helped to save lives.\n\nYour gift of blood may help up to three people. Donated red blood cells do not last forever. They have a shelf-life of up to 42 days. A healthy donor may donate every 56 days.\n",

            "question": "What should I do after donating blood?",
            "answer": "After you give blood:\nTake the following precautions:\n\nDrink an extra four glasses (eight ounces each) of non-alcoholic liquids.\nKeep your bandage on and dry for the next five hours, and do not do heavy exercising or lifting.\nIf the needle site starts to bleed, raise your arm straight up and press on the site until the bleeding stops.\nBecause you could experience dizziness or loss of strength, use caution if you plan to do anything that could put you or others at risk of harm. For any hazardous occupation or hobby, follow applicable safety recommendations regarding your return to these activities following a blood donation.\nEat healthy meals and consider adding iron-rich foods to your regular diet, or discuss taking an iron supplement with your health care provider, to replace the iron lost with blood donation.\nIf you get a bruise:\u00a0\u00a0Apply ice to the area intermittently for 10-15 minutes during the first 24 hours. Thereafter, apply warm, moist heat to the area intermittently for 10-15 minutes. A rainbow of colors may occur for about 10 days.\nIf you get dizzy or lightheaded:\u00a0\u00a0Stop what you are doing, lie down, and raise your feet until the feeling passes and you feel well enough to safely resume activities.\nAnd remember to enjoy the feeling of knowing you have helped save lives!\nSchedule your next appointment.\n\n",

Some individuals may be at risk of transferring communicable disease through blood donation due to exposure via travel or other activities or may encounter problems with blood donation due to their health.

            "question": "What is apheresis?",
            "answer": "Apheresis is the process by which platelets and other specific blood components (red cells or plasma) are collected from a donor. The word \u201capheresis\u201d is derived from the Greek word aphaeresis meaning \u201cto take away.\u201d This process is accomplished by using a machine called a cell separator. Blood is drawn from the donor and the platelets, or another blood component, are collected by the cell separator and the remaining components of the blood are returned to the donor during the donation. Each apheresis donation procedure takes about one-and-one-half to two hours. Donors can watch movies or relax during the donation.\n\n",

Platelets are critically important to the survival of many patients with clotting problems (aplastic anemia, leukemia) or cancer, and patients who will undergo organ transplants or major surgeries like heart bypass grafts. Platelets can only be stored for five days after being collected. Maintaining an adequate supply of this lifesaving, perishable product is an ongoing challenge.\n\n",

            "answer": "The Red Cross asks blood and platelet donors to select their race and ethnicity at the time of donation to help meet the unique transfusion needs of a diverse patient population. By identifying a donor\u2019s race and ethnicity, it helps the Red Cross better and more efficiently locate rare blood types to best meet the needs of all patients of all backgrounds. Certain blood characteristics are inherited, making them more likely to be found within certain donor groups.

            "answer": "An inconsistent result means that the Red Cross is not able to confirm a positive or negative screening result. In some cases, this is because the Red Cross immunohematology reference laboratory may have previously tested their donation for sickle cell trait at the request of a hospital to fulfill a specific product need. In these cases, the donor may have received a previous result of negative or positive. While the Red Cross will work to resolve many inconsistent results, a portion will remain inconsistent. \n",

            "answer": "It is estimated that about 1 in 13 Black or African American babies in the U.S. is born with sickle cell trait, which means they have inherited the sickle cell gene from one of their parents.

This screening is performed on a blood sample given during the standard donation process to look for the presence of an abnormal type of hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S or sickled hemoglobin, a key indicator of sickle cell trait. This means it is likely the individual inherited one sickle cell gene and one normal gene from their parents.

Sickle cell trait is inherited and means that an individual received one sickle cell gene and one normal gene from their parents. While, carrying the trait does not mean that an individual has sickle cell disease, health experts recommend that individuals with sickle cell trait be aware of their status and consult their medical provider on what it means for them.

However, these screening are not perfect. As with all tests and screening, false results, or a screening result that incorrectly states the presence of abnormal hemoglobin, can occur.
