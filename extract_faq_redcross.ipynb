As a result, after Aug. 7 donors who test positive for sickle cell trait – and current donors whose donations do not adequately pass the red blood cell filter process – are restricted from giving a whole blood or Power Red donations.

However, 51% of African Americans have type O (positive or negative) blood, in comparison to approximately 45% of white individuals.

Black donors play a vital role in helping meet the needs of all patients including – individuals who experience complicated childbirths, people fighting cancer, and accident victims being raced to emergency rooms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\n',\n",

The donation process from the time you arrive until the time you leave takes about an hour.\\xa0The donation itself is only about 8-10 minutes on average.\\xa0The steps in the process are:\\nRegistration\\n\\nYou will complete donor registration, which includes information such as your name, address, phone number, and donor identification number (if you have one).\\nYou will be asked to show a donor card, driver’s license or two other forms of ID.\\n\\nHealth History and Mini Physical\\n\\nYou\\xa0will answer some\\xa0questions\\xa0during a private and confidential interview about your health history and the places you have traveled.\\nYou will have your temperature, hemoglobin, blood pressure and pulse checked.\\n\\nDonation\\n\\nWe\\xa0will cleanse an area on your arm and insert a brand–new, sterile needle for the blood draw. This feels like a quick pinch and is over in seconds.\\nYou will have some time to relax while the bag is filling. (For a whole blood donation, it is about 8-10 minutes. If you are donating platelets, red cells or plasma by apheresis the collection can take up to 2 hours.)\\nWhen approximately a pint of blood has been collected, the donation is complete and a staff person will place a bandage on your arm.\\xa0\\n\\nRefreshments\\n\\nYou will spend a few minutes enjoying refreshments to allow your body time to adjust to the slight decrease in fluid volume. \\nAfter 10-15 minutes you can then leave the donation site and continue with your normal daily activities. \\nEnjoy the feeling of accomplishment knowing that you have helped to save lives.\\n\\nYour gift of blood may help up to three people.

       "  'answer': 'Apheresis is the process by which platelets and other specific blood components (red cells or plasma) are collected from a donor. The word “apheresis” is derived from the Greek word aphaeresis meaning “to take away.” This process is accomplished by using a machine called a cell separator. Blood is drawn from the donor and the platelets, or another blood component, are collected by the cell separator and the remaining components of the blood are returned to the donor during the donation. Each apheresis donation procedure takes about one-and-one-half to two hours. Donors can watch movies or relax during the donation.\\n\\n',\n",

Platelets are critically important to the survival of many patients with clotting problems (aplastic anemia, leukemia) or cancer, and patients who will undergo organ transplants or major surgeries like heart bypass grafts.

       "  'answer': 'The Red Cross asks blood and platelet donors to select their race and ethnicity at the time of donation to help meet the unique transfusion needs of a diverse patient population. By identifying a donor’s race and ethnicity, it helps the Red Cross better and more efficiently locate rare blood types to best meet the needs of all patients of all backgrounds. Certain blood characteristics are inherited, making them more likely to be found within certain donor groups.

In some cases, this is because the Red Cross immunohematology reference laboratory may have previously tested their donation for sickle cell trait at the request of a hospital to fulfill a specific product need. In these cases, the donor may have received a previous result of negative or positive.

This screening is performed on a blood sample given during the standard donation process to look for the presence of an abnormal type of hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S or sickled hemoglobin, a key indicator of sickle cell trait.
