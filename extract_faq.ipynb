The word “apheresis” is derived from the Greek word aphaeresis meaning “to take away.” This process is accomplished by using a machine called a cell separator. Blood is drawn from the donor and the platelets, or another blood component, are collected by the cell separator and the remaining components of the blood are returned to the donor during the donation. Each apheresis donation procedure takes about one-and-one-half to two hours. Donors can watch movies or relax during the donation.&lt;br&gt;\n",

Platelets are critically important to the survival of many patients with clotting problems (aplastic anemia, leukemia) or cancer, and patients who will undergo organ transplants or major surgeries like heart bypass grafts. Platelets can only be stored for five days after being collected. Maintaining an adequate supply of this lifesaving, perishable product is an ongoing challenge.&lt;br /&gt;\n",

By identifying a donor’s race and ethnicity, it helps the Red Cross better and more efficiently locate rare blood types to best meet the needs of all patients of all backgrounds. Certain blood characteristics are inherited, making them more likely to be found within certain donor groups. These matched blood products provide a more compatible unit for transfusion to patients in need.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

In some cases, this is because the Red Cross immunohematology reference laboratory may have previously tested their donation for sickle cell trait at the request of a hospital to fulfill a specific product need. In these cases, the donor may have received a previous result of negative or positive.

This screening is performed on a blood sample given during the standard donation process to look for the presence of an abnormal type of hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S or sickled hemoglobin, a key indicator of sickle cell trait. This means it is likely the individual inherited one sickle cell gene and one normal gene from their parents. If an individual receives a positive result, they should consult their medical provider to discuss their test results and pursue additional confirmatory diagnostic testing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n",

The word “apheresis” is derived from the Greek word aphaeresis meaning “to take away.” This process is accomplished by using a machine called a cell separator. Blood is drawn from the donor and the platelets, or another blood component, are collected by the cell separator and the remaining components of the blood are returned to the donor during the donation. Each apheresis donation procedure takes about one-and-one-half to two hours. Donors can watch movies or relax during the donation.&lt;br&gt;\n",

Platelets are critically important to the survival of many patients with clotting problems (aplastic anemia, leukemia) or cancer, and patients who will undergo organ transplants or major surgeries like heart bypass grafts. Platelets can only be stored for five days after being collected. Maintaining an adequate supply of this lifesaving, perishable product is an ongoing challenge.&lt;br /&gt;\n",

By identifying a donor’s race and ethnicity, it helps the Red Cross better and more efficiently locate rare blood types to best meet the needs of all patients of all backgrounds. Certain blood characteristics are inherited, making them more likely to be found within certain donor groups. These matched blood products provide a more compatible unit for transfusion to patients in need.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

In some cases, this is because the Red Cross immunohematology reference laboratory may have previously tested their donation for sickle cell trait at the request of a hospital to fulfill a specific product need. In these cases, the donor may have received a previous result of negative or positive.

This screening is performed on a blood sample given during the standard donation process to look for the presence of an abnormal type of hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S or sickled hemoglobin, a key indicator of sickle cell trait.

However, these screening are not perfect. As with all tests and screening, false results, or a screening result that incorrectly states the presence of abnormal hemoglobin, can occur.

This means it is likely the individual inherited one sickle cell gene and one normal gene from their parents. If an individual receives a positive result, they should consult their medical provider to discuss their test results and pursue additional confirmatory testing.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

The word “apheresis” is derived from the Greek word aphaeresis meaning “to take away.” This process is accomplished by using a machine called a cell separator. Blood is drawn from the donor and the platelets, or another blood component, are collected by the cell separator and the remaining components of the blood are returned to the donor during the donation.

The word “apheresis” is derived from the Greek word aphaeresis meaning “to take away.” This process is accomplished by using a machine called a cell separator. Blood is drawn from the donor and the platelets, or another blood component, are collected by the cell separator and the remaining components of the blood are returned to the donor during the donation. Each apheresis donation procedure takes about one-and-one-half to two hours. Donors can watch movies or relax during the donation.&lt;br&gt;\n",

Platelets are critically important to the survival of many patients with clotting problems (aplastic anemia, leukemia) or cancer, and patients who will undergo organ transplants or major surgeries like heart bypass grafts.

By identifying a donor’s race and ethnicity, it helps the Red Cross better and more efficiently locate rare blood types to best meet the needs of all patients of all backgrounds. Certain blood characteristics are inherited, making them more likely to be found within certain donor groups. These matched blood products provide a more compatible unit for transfusion to patients in need.&lt;/p&gt;\n",

In some cases, this is because the Red Cross immunohematology reference laboratory may have previously tested their donation for sickle cell trait at the request of a hospital to fulfill a specific product need. In these cases, the donor may have received a previous result of negative or positive.

This screening is performed on a blood sample given during the standard donation process to look for the presence of an abnormal type of hemoglobin, called hemoglobin S or sickled hemoglobin, a key indicator of sickle cell trait.

This means it is likely the individual inherited one sickle cell gene and one normal gene from their parents. If an individual receives a positive result, they should consult their medical provider to discuss their test results and pursue additional confirmatory testing.\\nIn addition to providing individuals with their results via the Blood Donor App and donor portal on RedCrossBlood.org, those who have positive results will also receive a letter in the mail.\\nIt’s important to note, that carrying the sickle cell trait does not mean that an individual has sickle cell disease.
